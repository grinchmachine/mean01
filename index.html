          HELP!<br><br>
          Oh good you got the letter! We didn't mean any of it.<br><br>
          The Grinch has kidnapped us, and he forced us to write that mean letter to you! We hid a secret message in it.<br><br>
          We are trapped in the Grinch’s lair, he built a christmas ruining robot called M.E.A.N.1.<br><br>
          The M.E.A.N.1 is keeping us imprisoned and is sending that letter to our loved ones.<br><br>
          This is a backdoor channel into the M.E.A.N.1, you can destroy the robot and free us but you need the master password.<br><br>
          We don't know what the password is. Maybe you can find it.<br><br>
          We should have seen this coming. We could swear we have seen him snooping around. We can almost PICTURE him! We caught a glimpse of him but it was just for an instant. He doesn't have a gram of decency! But we trust you'll be able to hash this out.<br><br>
          Please help us, Bilbo hasn’t had a treat in 4 hours!<br><br>
          Hurry,<br>
          The REAL Jerbo, Ani and Bilbo
